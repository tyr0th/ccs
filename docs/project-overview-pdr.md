# CCS Product Development Requirements (PDR)

Last Updated: 2026-03-24

## Product Overview

**Product Name**: CCS (Claude Code Switch)

**Tagline**: The universal AI profile manager for Claude Code

**Description**: CLI wrapper enabling seamless switching between multiple Claude accounts and alternative AI providers (GLM, Gemini, Codex, OpenRouter, Qwen, Kimi, DeepSeek) with a React-based dashboard for configuration management. Supports both local and remote CLIProxyAPI instances, hybrid quota management, and official Claude channel runtime setup for Telegram, Discord, and iMessage.

**Current Version**: v7.34.x (Image Analysis Hook + Performance Improvements)

---

## Problem Statement

Developers using Claude Code face these challenges:

1. **Single Account Limitation**: Cannot run multiple Claude subscriptions simultaneously
2. **Provider Lock-in**: Stuck with Anthropic's API, cannot use alternatives
3. **No Concurrent Sessions**: Cannot work on different projects with different accounts
4. **Complex Configuration**: Manual env var and config file management
5. **No Usage Analytics**: Lack visibility into token usage and costs across providers

---

## Solution

CCS provides:

1. **Multi-Account Claude**: Isolated instances via `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`
2. **OAuth Providers**: Zero-config Gemini, Codex, Antigravity, Copilot, Kiro (ghcp) integration
3. **AI Providers**: Dedicated CLIProxy dashboard for Gemini, Codex, Claude, Vertex, and OpenAI-compatible API-key families
4. **API Profiles**: GLM, Kimi, OpenRouter, any Anthropic-compatible API
5. **Visual Dashboard**: React SPA for configuration management
6. **Automatic WebSearch**: Real backend fallback chain for third-party providers
7. **Usage Analytics**: Token tracking, cost analysis, model breakdown
8. **Official Claude Channels**: Runtime auto-enable plus dashboard token/config flow for Telegram, Discord, and macOS-only iMessage

## Functional Requirements

### FR-001: Profile Switching
- Switch between profiles with `ccs <profile>` command
- Support default profile when no argument provided
- Pass through all Claude CLI arguments

### FR-002: Multi-Account Claude
- Create isolated Claude instances
- Maintain separate sessions, todolists, logs per account
- Share commands, skills, agents across accounts

### FR-003: OAuth Provider Integration
- Support Gemini, Codex, Antigravity, Copilot, Kiro (ghcp) OAuth flows
- Browser-based authentication (Authorization Code flow for most, Device Code for ghcp)
- Token caching and refresh

### FR-004: API Profile Management
- Configure custom API endpoints
- Support Anthropic-compatible APIs
- Model mapping and configuration
- OpenRouter integration with 300+ models

### FR-004A: CLIProxy AI Provider Management
- Configure CLIProxy-managed Gemini, Codex, Claude, Vertex, and OpenAI-compatible API-key entries
- Keep provider authoring separate from CCS API Profile creation
- Support local config editing and remote CLIProxy management parity where available

### FR-005: Dashboard UI
- Visual profile management
- Real-time health monitoring
- Usage analytics with cost tracking
- Modular page architecture (settings, analytics, auth-monitor)

### FR-006: Health Diagnostics
- Verify Claude CLI installation
- Check config file integrity
- Validate symlinks and permissions

### FR-007: WebSearch Fallback
- Intercept WebSearch for third-party profiles that cannot reach Anthropic's native tool
- Support Exa, Tavily, Brave, and DuckDuckGo real search backends
- Keep Gemini CLI, OpenCode, and Grok as optional legacy fallback
- Graceful fallback chain

### FR-008: Remote CLIProxy Support
- Connect to remote CLIProxyAPI instances
- CLI flags for proxy configuration (--proxy-host, --proxy-port, etc.)
- Environment variable configuration (CCS_PROXY_HOST, etc.)
- Fallback to local proxy when remote unreachable
- Protocol-based default ports (443 for HTTPS, 8317 for HTTP)
- Dashboard UI for remote server configuration and testing

### FR-009: Quota Management (v7.14)
- Pause/resume individual accounts via `ccs cliproxy pause/resume <account>`
- Check quota status via `ccs cliproxy status [account]`
- Auto-failover when account exhausted
- Tier detection: free/paid/unknown
- Pre-flight quota checks before session start
- Dashboard UI with pause/resume toggles and tier badges

### FR-010: Docker Deployment
- Multi-stage Dockerfile with bun 1.2.21 and node:20-bookworm-slim
- Docker Compose setup with resource limits and healthcheck
- Persistent volumes for config, credentials, and CLI tools
- Pre-installed CLIs: claude, gemini, grok, opencode, ccs
- Ports: 3000 (Dashboard), 8317 (CLIProxy)
- Entrypoint with privilege dropping and usage help
- Environment variable configuration support

### FR-011: Third-Party Tool Integration
- Export shell-evaluable env vars via `ccs env` command
- Support OpenAI, Anthropic, raw output formats
- Auto-detect shell (bash/zsh, fish, PowerShell) from $SHELL
- Security: single-quoted output, key sanitization, shell-specific escaping
- Cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Linux, Windows)

### FR-012: Official Claude Channels
- Support Telegram, Discord, and iMessage selection via `ccs config channels` and the dashboard
- Auto-inject `--channels` only for native Claude `default` and `account` sessions
- Store Telegram/Discord bot tokens in Claude's own `~/.claude/channels/<channel>/.env` state or the official `*_STATE_DIR` override path when one is configured
- Treat iMessage as macOS-only, tokenless, and dependent on Claude-side install plus OS permissions
- Require Bun, Claude Code v2.1.80+, and verified `claude.ai` auth before runtime auto-enable
- Keep `--dangerously-skip-permissions` optional and never add it when the user already made an explicit permission choice
- Surface platform/auth/version/setup blockers clearly in both CLI and dashboard flows
- Preserve dashboard token drafts when save/refresh fails, and let already-selected unsupported iMessage entries be turned off without allowing re-enable on unsupported platforms

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001: Performance
- CLI startup < 100ms
- Dashboard load < 2s
- Minimal memory footprint

### NFR-002: Reliability
- Idempotent operations
- Graceful error handling
- Automatic recovery where possible

### NFR-003: Security
- Local-only proxy binding (127.0.0.1)
- No credential exposure in logs
- Secure token storage

### NFR-004: Cross-Platform
- Support Linux, macOS, Windows

---

## Technical Requirements

### TR-001: Runtime Dependencies
- Node.js 14+ or Bun 1.0+
- Claude Code CLI installed
- Internet access for OAuth/API calls

### TR-002: Optional Dependencies
- CLIProxyAPI binary (auto-managed)
- Exa/Tavily/Brave API keys for higher-quality WebSearch
- Gemini CLI for legacy WebSearch fallback
- Bun plus Claude Code v2.1.80+ with `claude.ai` auth for Official Channels auto-enable

### TR-003: Configuration
- YAML-based config (`~/.ccs/config.yaml`)
- JSON settings per profile
- Environment variable overrides
- Official channel bot tokens stored in Claude-managed `~/.claude/channels/<channel>/.env`

---

## Architecture Constraints

### AC-001: CLI-First Design
- All features accessible via CLI
- Dashboard is convenience layer, not required
- Scriptable and automatable

### AC-002: Non-Invasive
- Never modify `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Reversible changes only

### AC-003: Proxy Pattern
- Use local proxy for provider routing
- Claude CLI communicates with localhost
- Proxy handles upstream API calls

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Startup time | < 100ms | Achieved |
| Dashboard load | < 2s | Achieved |
| Error rate | < 1% | Achieved |
| Test coverage | > 90% | 90% (1440 tests, 6 skipped) |
